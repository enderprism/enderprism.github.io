I saw tweets/Xeets/ùïèeets/posts/whatever thing it's called from [TodePond](https://www.todepond.com/) telling me I should make a blog.
So I did. And here you are! Lovely internet person.

The point of this website was also to be an [extension to my Discord bio](/about) and also a [portfolio](/portfolio) for later use.

I don't really know how to elaborate further, so I'll leave this post as is, and it's my first post here anyway so it's fine.

I'll also leave a link to his [wikiblogarden article](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/blog/) which partly lead to the creation of this website.
